# Phase 5: Data Migration Overview
*Shigodeki Architecture Evolution - Session 5.1*

## Migration Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the data migration strategy from the current family-based structure to the new project-based hierarchy.

---

## Migration Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Zero Data Loss**: All existing user data must be preserved
2. **Zero Downtime**: Users continue using the app during migration
3. **Seamless Transition**: Users experience minimal disruption
4. **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert if issues arise

### Success Criteria
- 100% data migration success rate
- All user relationships preserved
- Task completion history maintained
- No service interruption

---

## Current vs Target Architecture

### Before Migration
```
users/{userId}
├── familyIds: [string]

families/{familyId}
├── taskLists/{listId}/
│   └── tasks/{taskId}
```

### After Migration
```
users/{userId}
├── projectIds: [string]
├── roleAssignments: {projectId: role}

projects/{projectId}
├── phases/{phaseId}/
│   └── lists/{listId}/
│       └── tasks/{taskId}/
│           └── subtasks/{subtaskId}
```

## Migration Strategy Overview

### Phase 1: Preparation
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Activities**: Setup migration infrastructure, backup creation
- **Impact**: None - invisible to users

### Phase 2: Gradual Migration
- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
- **Activities**: User-by-user migration with dual-mode support
- **Impact**: Minimal - users may see "updating" indicators

### Phase 3: Completion
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Activities**: Final verification, cleanup, legacy data removal
- **Impact**: None - enhanced features become available

---

## Migration Components

### 1. Migration Infrastructure
- **Cloud Functions** for secure server-side migration
- **Client-side compatibility layer** for dual-mode operation
- **Migration tracking system** for progress monitoring
- **Error handling and retry mechanisms**

### 2. Data Transformation Pipeline
- **Family → Project conversion** with role assignment
- **TaskList → Phase/List mapping** with proper hierarchy
- **Task preservation** with enhanced metadata
- **User relationship migration** with role-based permissions

### 3. Safety Mechanisms  
- **Automatic backups** before each migration step
- **Rollback procedures** for failed migrations
- **Data integrity verification** after each user migration
- **Progressive rollout** to limit blast radius

---

## Migration Modes

### Dual-Mode Operation
During migration, the app supports both old and new data structures:

#### For Unmigrated Users
- Continue using family-based UI and data
- Full feature access with existing architecture
- Invisible preparation for migration

#### For Migrated Users  
- New project-based UI and enhanced features
- Access to subtasks and advanced organization
- Improved sharing and permission system

### Compatibility Layer
- **Data Access Abstraction**: Single API for both data models
- **UI State Management**: Seamless switching between modes
- **Real-time Sync**: Consistent updates regardless of user migration status

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Scenarios
1. **Migration Failure**: Comprehensive rollback procedures
2. **Data Corruption**: Multiple backup layers and verification
3. **Performance Degradation**: Staged rollout and monitoring
4. **User Confusion**: Clear communication and help documentation

### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Real-time migration progress** tracking
- **Error rate monitoring** with automatic alerts
- **Performance impact** measurement and mitigation
- **User feedback** collection and rapid response

## Documentation Structure

This migration strategy is divided into focused documents:

1. **[Migration Technical Plan](./phase5-migration-technical-plan.md)**
   - Detailed technical implementation
   - Cloud Functions architecture
   - Data transformation logic

2. **[Migration Safety Procedures](./phase5-migration-safety-procedures.md)**
   - Backup and rollback procedures
   - Data integrity verification
   - Error handling and recovery

3. **[Migration Implementation Timeline](./phase5-migration-timeline.md)**
   - Week-by-week implementation plan
   - Milestone definitions and success criteria
   - Resource allocation and responsibilities

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review technical implementation** details in companion documents
2. **Set up migration infrastructure** based on technical plan
3. **Implement safety procedures** before beginning user migration
4. **Execute staged rollout** following the defined timeline
